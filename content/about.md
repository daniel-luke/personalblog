Several years ago, I found myself in a predicament. My foundation *(as in my house, my job, my money)* was gone. As far as the term 'hitting rock bottom', I'd say that my situation came quite close to that.

Since then, I've tried to find a more structured 'way of living', and when stumbling on Stoicism, I knew it would be valuable for me. As I'm a practical person, and the philosophy itself is practical too.

I sought to read as much as possible about Stoicism. I watched every YouTube video and read every article of [Ryan Holiday](https://www.dailystoic.com). I started daily listen to [The Stoic Coffee Break](https://stoic.coffee/). *(Which I both definitely recommend!)* 

Since then, I've come a long way. I managed to adapt a practical set of rules to help me guide through life's ups and downs. All the while slowly building back up my foundation, and in the process, write about it!

I've started this blog, **not** to promote Stoicism, **not** to shout my opinion from the rooftops or to monetize on the popularity Stoicism has gained through the years. But to share my personal experiences and by sharing them, hopefully inspire others to give thought about how they could be a better person, day by day.

To finish this off, I'd like to leave you with one of the quotes from *Marcus Aurelius* in which I found solice.

> The more we value things outside our control, the less control we have. - Marcus Aurelius
